This is a LinkedIn clone web application built with React and Ruby on Rails. It provides similar functionality to LinkedIn, including user authentication, post creation, likes, comments and user profiles.

# Features

User authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out. Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.
Error Handling: Upon sign up or log in, proper error handling notifies users of invalid credentials or params.
User profiles: Each user has a profile with their name, profile picture, bio, and other relevant information.
Posts: Users can create, edit, and delete posts. Users can comment and like/unlike a post.
News feed: The home page displays a news feed with the latest posts from all users.
# Technologies Used

Frontend: React, Redux, HTML, CSS
Backend: Node.js, Ruby on Rails
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens

# Usage

Sign up for a new account using the registration form.
Log in with your credentials on the login page or the welcome page.
Log in with the demo user to bypass signing up.
Explore the home page to see the latest posts from users you follow.
Create new posts by clicking on the "Create Post" modal.
Edit and delete posts by clicking through the post's dropdown menu.

# Future Implementation
Search: Users can search for other users by name, job title, or other criteria.
WebSocket: Users can live chat with one another.
View and edit your profile by clicking on your profile picture or name.
