This is a LinkedIn clone web application built with React and Ruby on Rails. It provides similar functionality to LinkedIn, including user authentication, post creation, and user profiles.

Error Handling: Upon sign up or log in, proper error handling notifies users of invalid credentials or params.
User profiles: Each user has a profile with their name, profile picture, bio, and other relevant information.
Posts: Users can create, edit, and delete posts. Posts can include text, images, and other media.
News feed: The home page displays a news feed with the latest posts from all users.
# Technologies Used

Frontend: React, Redux, HTML, CSS
Backend: Node.js, Ruby on Rails
